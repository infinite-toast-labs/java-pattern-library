Pattern Library

## Phase 1

- [ ] Array / dynamic array
- [ ] Linked list (singly, doubly)
- [ ] Stack, Queue, Deque
- [ ] HashMap (understand hashing + collision handling)
- [ ] Binary tree, BST
- [ ] Heap / priority queue
- [ ] Trie

## Phase 2

- [ ] Graph (adjacency list + adjacency matrix)
- [ ] Binary search (and its variations — lower bound, upper bound)
- [ ] Two pointers, sliding window
- [ ] BFS, DFS (both iterative and recursive)
- [ ] Sorting (mergesort, quicksort — understand why O(n log n))
- [ ] Dijkstra's, topological sort
- [ ] Union-Find

## Phase 3

- [ ] Recursion → memoization → bottom-up DP
- [ ] Greedy (and how to tell when greedy works vs when you need DP)
- [ ] Backtracking
- [ ] Monotonic stack/queue
- [ ] Interval scheduling
